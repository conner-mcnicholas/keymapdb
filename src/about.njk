            KeymapDB (“Keymap Database”) is a public and open-source online database for keymaps of programmable keyboards, with a focus on QMK ergonomic keyboards. Here, you'll find a curated list of keymaps to take inspiration from, with a slew of filters you can use to find the user-submitted keymaps that will interest you.

            KeymapDB is NOT:
            <ul>
                <li>A collection of alpha keyboard layouts (Colemak, Dvorak, AZERTY, BEAKL, …). 
                    Better luck in the “<a href="https://www.keyboard-design.com/internet-letter-layout-db.html" class="font-medium">Internet Letter Layout DB (ILLDB)</a>”.</li>
                <li>A collection of mechanical keyboards. Visit <a href="https://yal-tools.github.io/ergo-keyboards/" class="font-medium">YellowAfterLife's keyboard list</a> if that's what you want.</li>
            </ul>
