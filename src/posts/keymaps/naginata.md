summary: "Kana-based Japanese system for ergonomic keyboards with thumbs-keys, or traditional keyboards with spacebar used as shift. Dakuten (or handakuten) are combos with other hand's index-finger on the home (or bottom) row. Combos with ya/yu/yo give compound kana (yōon, at most three keys). Punctuation, navigation, and macros are on layers. Currently v16 (2025). Multiple community implementations exist."
